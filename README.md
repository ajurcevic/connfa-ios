This is a new iOS Connfa! It is developed in Swift with updated UI/UX. The app retrieves data from Firebase BAAS - the serverless cloud-based solution with NoSQL Database. Powerfull Firebase SDK uses local cache on the devices to serve and store changes and maintain realtime synchronisation “out of the box”.

Please notice, that if your aim is to build iOS + Android + Integration Server(CMS) for your conference, then you should refer to Objective-C iOS Connfa!, which is now available in [connfa-objc](https://github.com/lemberg/connfa-ios/tree/connfa-objc) branch.

Documentation is available on [https://connfa.com/](https://connfa.com/).

Project is supported by [Lemberg Solutions](https://lembergsolutions.com/).
